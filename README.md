# Integral-Calculator-Midpoint-Riemann-Sum

This is the first ever large scale program I created and while it could use a lot of work this program was written in May 2017 for the final project of my first computer class.

I have come a long way, but this was the start of my love of coding and the first time I ever made something that I was proud of. I have left the code as is except a small bit of refactoring to use vectors. Input Validation is not present and the code does not contain many features of C++ which now that I know about I would add.
